                It all started a year after graduating college, I decided to move out of my childhood house and live on my own. As a young working professional, I thought I saved enough of my income to 
be self-sufficient and financially independent. Soon after the move, I learned that it was very difficult to budget my spending and track my personal finances. I spent a lot of time thinking about how I should better my financial health for the future, but I didn’t know how.

            <p class="mrg-btm-md">
                At first I though my problem statement was this: Millennials need a way to keep track of their personal finances because they want to save for big investments in the future, like purchasing a house. However, I learned that this was not actually the problem.

            <p class="mrg-btm-sm">
                To learn more about the problem, I began competitor analysis. My Findings: I learned that competitors do not necessarily have to be companies or products that are related to the same topic, such as finances. Instead, I discovered competitors can be companies or services that take the time of user’s that you also want to target. This was an eye opener to me and taught me to think more broadly about who/what competitors can be. Thinking this way made me realize mindfulness apps, like Headspace, is a competitor to financial apps since they provide a service that people want to use and feel good about using, which is usually the opposite sentiment of using a financial app.

                After the competitive analysis, I wanted to learn more about user goals. To further my research, I conducted user interviews and gave out surveys with specific questions about what I wanted to know more about. My goal was to find out how people feel about tracking personal finances, what do people want, and what do they need? I organized my findings in an affinity map to find potential groupings and similarities.

           <!-- <p class="mrg-btm-sm">
                Key Takeaways: Most people felt they were financially stable, but would like to do a better job tracking their finances more consistently. They would like to be more educated on how to create budgets and maintain/grow their financial health. Many don't track their finances or budgets because it is too much of a hassle. Target users feel guilty about making purchases. Target users value being present and in the moment.

            <p class="mrg-btm-sm">
               Due to time constraints, I moved past wireframes and jumped into creating a paper prototype of one feature. I quickly tested the paper prototype and found out that the user flow was intuituve, but users struggled to find how to create a goal and wanted more customization added to making goals. After user testing the paper prototype, I then developed a digital prototype with revisions based on user feedback.

               Overall, my first digital prototype was successful in that users were able to complete tasks and felt confident interacting with the interface. However, I learned there are more ways I need to improve the product. Key Findings: Users felt experience was easy to use and intuitive, users would like more education about how to set budget limits, some users were confused when a goal was added because they didn’t notice a visual change, users would likely use the app again especially if more features were built out.

               Add color or a visual cue when a new budget or goal is added to the list, so users know to fill in input. Build an education feature that suggests a formula to calculate a suggested budget limit so users can learn the process and the math behind budgeting. Also, build a simple and easy sign up page that is quick for users to onboard their financial accounts.

            <p class="mrg-btm-lg">
               From this UX case study, I learned that it is important to always ask "Why?". When I found myself getting stuck, whether it was definig my problem statement or prototyping, I kept asking the question "Why?". This question helped me focus on the problem I am trying to solve and really understand what is important and how can I improve the experience or the solution for the user.
